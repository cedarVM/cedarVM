# `whoami`

I am Matthew Louden, a Junior Computer Science student at Cedarville University. My interests and obsessions range from [golfing languages](https://emkc.org/contests/41/find-a-word) to [visualizing mathematics](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/m0u7yw/distribution_of_primes_along_a_hilbert_curve/). You can reach me at [mlouden@cedarville.edu](dead). You can discover more from me [here](https://github.com/xleph).

# Top five favorite personal projects
1. [Surface Go Boardgame](https://github.com/cedarVM/boardgame)
   - A game of rafts (with cannons?) that is programmed entirely in C and the old X11 API.
2. [Sokoban](https://github.com/cedarVM/initAgony)
   - Final project for Digital Logic Design (2023F). The compiled binaries are Quartus DE1-SoC specific executables. There's some code for bitmap to ROM level generation.
3. [Prime number density](https://github.com/xleph/HilbertPrimes)
   - Prime numbers are cool. Ever heard of Ulam spirals?
5. (2, 4) tree deletion procedure for [Data Structures](https://github.com/CedarvilleCS2210/cs2210termproj-fa24-cedarVM) (2024F)
   - Implementation of a (2, 4) tree.
6. [CedarvilleDucks](https://github.com/cedarVM/CedarvilleDucks)
   - Simple Unity game that mimics grid defense games

# Current Projects
1. Re-indexing and cataloguing all of my previous projects
2. Explaining [this](deadlinkfortheprimecountrange)
3. Finding the zeroes of the following multivariable expression:
